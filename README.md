# SC1015 Mini Project - Identifying factors relating to Heart Disease

## About

This is a Mini Project for SC1015 (Introduction to Data Science and Artificial Intelligence) which focuses on factors relating to Heart Disease. The heart disease dataset is originally generated by the [Centers for Disesase Control and Prevention US (CDC)](https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/annual_data/annual_2020.html). The dataset was then cleaned and published into a CSV file on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kamilpytlak/personal-key-indicators-of-heart-disease?select=heart_2020_cleaned.csv).

## Problem Definition

Based on the dataset are we able to predict heart disease based on certain health attributes?
Which models and factors would be most effective in predicting heart disease?

## Models Used

Logistic Regression

## Conclusion

Based on the correlation we calculated, we removed the variables that did not contribute to the model whilst recording the model accuracy. These variables include 'Mental Health', 'Sleep Time', 'BMI', 'Physical Activity' and 'General Health'. Though 'Race' had a low correlation, when removed from the model, the accuracy had a considerable deprovement, as such we decided to keep it in the model. Through this, we can see that variables such as 'Physical Health' and 'Age Category' are good predictors for Heart Disease.
